He cited her hardscrabble upbringing. And he even quoted his father to emphasize her set of values.
""Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget. I'll tell you what you value,"" he said. ""That's what you're going to do for us, Neera.""
The President-elect seemed confident, as did Tanden when she spoke a few minutes later, that she would soon be ensconced in the Office of Management and Budget suite next door to the West Wing.
But behind the scenes -- on Capitol Hill, in Democratic circles and even among some of Biden's allies -- few shared the bullish outlook. Tanden's history of sharp-edged tweets about Republicans and Democrats alike made her a polarizing figure. And at the time, it wasn't even clear Democrats would control the Senate.
The slow collapse, drawn out over weeks, came to a conclusion late Tuesday, when the White House announced Tanden had withdrawn her nomination to avoid further distraction. In his own statement, Biden said he would still award her a position in his administration, albeit one that doesn't require Senate confirmation.
The person viewed as a leading contender to be nominated in Tanden's place -- Shalanda Young, Biden's pick to be deputy OMB director -- had breezed through a confirmation hearing on Tuesday, earning praise even from conservative Republicans.
A lesson for the Biden White House
The selection of Tanden, a close friend of White House chief of staff Ron Klain, may offer an instructive, forward-looking lesson for the seasoned Biden administration: Despite decades of political experience in Washington, they are now operating under razor-thin Democratic majorities in Congress in a capital still very much unsettled by the Trump era.
Tanden's downfall amounts to the first real stumble for the new team, which has still seen the bulk of Biden's Cabinet selections approved by wide bipartisan majorities. All recent presidents have had one or more of their nominees fail. It took President Barack Obama, for example, three attempts to find a commerce secretary and two tries to get a health and human services secretary confirmed. By the time he departed office, President Donald Trump had all but given up on making high-profile nominations at all, preferring to name acting secretaries instead.
Since the moment of her nomination on December 1, Tanden worked to allay the skepticism about her selection -- from Democrats and Republicans alike. For much of the last three months, she met with 46 different senators, officials said, offering apologies and explanations for her salty, and often offensive, tweets that she blasted out during Trump's tenure. The fact that the downfall of Tanden's nomination was her Twitter account is an ironic turn of events given the vitriol that often spewed from the former President on the same platform before he was suspended earlier this year.
""I deeply regret and apologize for my language and some of my past language,"" Tanden said at her confirmation hearing last month, a recognition that she still had work to do to win the hearts and minds of the senators who would determine her fate.
In the end, it wasn't enough. Even more, an administration official told CNN, the political capital being spent trying to salvage her confirmation is needed on trying to thread the complicated needle among Democrats to pass the Covid-19 relief bill in the Senate.
The episode underscores the governing constraints facing Biden despite enjoying Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate. And it illustrates what some Biden allies describe as overconfidence by the President and his chief of staff -- who was instrumental in pushing for Tanden's selection in managing a delicate political reality on Capitol Hill.
Tanden's nomination was effectively scuttled by a single centrist Democrat: Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, whose statement of opposition last month on a Friday afternoon sent the White House scrambling and provided an early warning of how a single vote can thwart Biden's legislative agenda. Manchin cited Tanden's ""overtly partisan statements,"" which he said would create toxicity between the White House and Capitol Hill.
Spending political capital
Manchin's skepticism opened the door to more, but the White House insisted it wasn't over for Tanden yet. And at Klain's urging, the administration continued pushing for her to be confirmed, even as it became ever clearer she would not gain enough support. 
Officials sought to highlight backing from moderate Republicans outside of Congress, including former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. And they repeatedly pointed to her historic credentials -- she would have been the first woman of South Asian descent to run OMB -- as evidence of her worthiness for confirmation.
One official said the White House wanted to demonstrate it would fight for its nominees, even though many inside the building acknowledged Tanden's nomination was likely doomed. The official said it would have looked weak had Biden caved, particularly because the main criticism of Tanden -- that her tweets were cruel -- could be viewed as sexist.
""Let me be clear: We're going to get Neera Tanden confirmed. That's what we're working for,"" Klain said during an appearance on MSNBC last week.
He was not alone in his desire to keep pushing; Biden himself was on board, as were other senior advisers, according to people familiar with the matter.
""We're going to push,"" Biden said last month, even as it became clear the door to confirmation was closing. ""We still think there's a shot, a good shot.""
Still, inside the administration, Klain was viewed as Tanden's strongest advocate and the most ardent voice in pushing to continue her nomination.
""Ron is not a dispassionate observer here,"" a senior Democrat who has previously worked with Klain told CNN last week, ahead of Tanden's withdrawal, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the White House. ""He selected Neera and doesn't want this to fail.""
Yet the troubling signs continued. Multiple aides told CNN that Biden's team was leaning so confidently into the idea of their party falling in line on nominations that minimal outreach was conducted to convince moderate Republicans to vote for Tanden.
On Wednesday last week, the two committees that had been scheduled to hold votes on Tanden's nomination abruptly delayed them. But it was not Republicans causing the holdup; Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a centrist Democrat from Arizona, refused to say how she would vote, and the committee did not want to risk moving forward without knowing the outcome.
The nomination appeared finally dead after Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a moderate Republican from Alaska, signaled to the White House that -- despite a one-on-one meeting where issues related to her state had been discussed in detail -- she would not support Tanden's nomination.
Speaking in the moments after Tanden's withdrawal was announced, Murkowski did not seem surprised.
""It was kind of going that direction,"" she said, going on to describe how she had shown Tanden maps of Alaska's tribal lands during their highly anticipated meeting.
In trouble from the start
It wasn't how Biden, Tanden or Klain had envisioned things going three months ago.
When Tanden was selected, the Biden transition team had believed Republicans would control the Senate, which made her nomination even more confounding. But at the time, Biden and his aides leaned heavily into her background, including how she had been raised by a single mother who came to the United States from India.
""I'm here today because of social programs,"" Tanden said on the day of her nomination, standing onstage near Biden in Wilmington. ""Because of budgetary choices. Because of a government that saw my mother's dignity, and gave her a chance.""
Yet one of the biggest roadblocks to confirmation came after the Georgia runoff races effectively handed control of the Senate to Democrats, which suddenly made Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, the leader of the Budget Committee.
Tanden and Sanders had tangled publicly for years, dating back to the 2016 presidential campaign, when she worked as a top adviser to Hillary Clinton. Sanders blamed Tanden, among other establishment Democrats, for his loss in the primary race.
Until the final moments on Tuesday, Sanders had not embraced her as Biden's nominee to lead OMB.
""Neera Tanden does not have the votes, so we'll have to see what happens in the future,"" Sanders told CNN's Wolf Blitzer shortly before the White House pulled her nomination. 
When pressed for his position, Sanders replied, ""I'll make that decision when the vote takes place.""

Murkowski also noted that White House officials never directly asked how she would vote.
I never did, they never asked, she said when asked if she ever told the White House how she would vote on the nominee.
Now she will be spared what could have been a difficult decision after she met with Tanden Monday and carefully walked the nominee through the various issues facing Alaska and the impact of Bidens seven executive actions on her home state.
Now it means Im going to have to do the Alaska tutorial 101 all over again with whoever it is that they name because I need this person to understand our challenges, she said of Bidens next pick to head the budget office.
Its possible that Tanden decided to withdraw her nomination because of additional opposition from Democrats such as centrist Sen.

Democrats control a 50-50 Senate because Vice President Kamarla Harris has the tie-breaking vote.
As a result Democrats usually can't afford any defections but Biden officials had some hope last week that Murkowski could be persuaded to vote for Tanden to make up for Manchin's ""no"" vote.
But Tanden's nomination suffered another setback when the Senate Budget and Homeland Security Committees cancelled scheduled votes.
It was kind of going that relation last week when they moved those two committee hearings, Murkowski said of last weeks postponement of two committee meetings to vote on Tanden.
I dont think she thought she was going to be pulled, Murkowski said, based on her conversation with the nominee during a sit-down meeting Monday.
Murkowski said she went into that meeting with an open mind and turned the session into Alaska 101 in which they discussed issues ranging from why the Centers for Disease Control was important for getting movement on a conditional no-sale order to every project that comes up with what were doing with murdered, missing and indigenous women.
The Alaska senator said he gave Tanden the courtesy of a conversation as I do with just about every nominee who asks for one.
Shes really a smart woman, Ill tell you that, she said of Tanden.
Asked if she asked the administration for any specific concessions such as on oil and gas drilling in Alaska, Murkowski said she has made extensive efforts to educate Biden administration officials and potential officials about the numerous federal land restrictions affecting her state.
I show you the map about my roadless areas, she said. I go through all of the land management structure and say this is the challenge I have with my state right now, noting the pause Biden has imposed on oil and gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.
But Murkowski said she didnt ask for any quid pro quo or commitment from the White House in exchange for backing Tanden.
If youre asking [did I ask,] If I do this, will you do that? No, she said.

Weve got an industry that is really in a fragile position right now because of the administrations executive orders, she said of Bidens orders on oil and gas drilling. We need some focus, we need some attention.
I said to Tanden, Look the North Slope Area, this is called the National Petroleum Reserve for a reason. This is where we get x-percent of our revenues and walked her through many of the challenges we have, she added.
Murkowski noted that Tanden generated her own level of controversy because of her leadership of the progressive think tank, the Center for American Progress, and the very public-focused tweets in which she criticized senators, sometimes harshly.
But the GOP senator said she wasnt going to automatically dismiss the nominee.
I said, no I think its important to talk to her, she said.

Here are the names to watch as the Biden White House zeroes in on a new nominee for OMB director.
Shalanda Young
Shalanda Young is Bidens pick for deputy director of OMB, making her a natural pick to elevate to the head of the agency, and she has received the most buzz of any potential nominee in the 24 hours since Tanden pulled out of consideration.

Perhaps most importantly, multiple Republican senators have indicated they would support Young for both the deputy director role and the director job should she be nominated for the latter.

Young spent the past 14 years as a staffer on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, most recently in the top post of staff director. Young would be the first woman of color to lead OMB if nominated and confirmed.
Ann OLeary
Ann OLeary has been floated as a possible replacement for Tanden dating back to mid-February when it appeared the latters nomination was in jeopardy.

OLeary told Politico at the time that she was 1,000 percent behind Tanden as the nominee.

Sperling worked extensively on economic policy in both administrations. He worked as an aide to the Treasury secretary during the Obama administration before leading the NEC. 
His supporters have touted Sperlings experience on Capitol Hill and in budget fights paired with his time in the Obama White House, arguing it will help him navigate difficult budget fights.
But Tanden was a woman of color, and the Biden White House will likely face pressure to nominate a diverse candidate in her place.
Chris Lu, Nani Coloretti or Sonal Shah

The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and advocacy groups are urging Biden to consider an Asian American or Pacific Islander to replace Tanden, who would have been the first Indian-American woman to lead OMB.
Among the names being pushed are Chris Lu, who served as Cabinet secretary during the Obama administration; Nani Coloretti, who was deputy secretary of Housing and Urban Development during the Obama administration; and Sonal Shah, who founded the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation in the Obama White House and most recently served as national policy director on Pete ButtigiegPete ButtigiegHarris pushes for support for cities in coronavirus relief package Exclusive: How Obama went to bat for WarrenThe Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Biden vs. Trump, part IIMOREs presidential campaign.

Advocates have noted that Asian Americans are the fastest growing demographic group in the United States, making representation in Bidens Cabinet particularly important.

She will bring valuable perspective and insight to our work.
Tanden is incredibly grateful for your leadership on behalf of the American people and for your agenda that will make such a transformative difference in peoples lives, she told Biden.
Her nomination began to collapse last month when Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said he would oppose Tanden for the post, citing her past remarks targeting Republicans. That meant she would need at least one Republican vote to be confirmed in the 50-50 Senate, but potential swing votes including Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) also said they would not back her.
Tanden, a veteran political operative who most recently led the liberal Washington-based Center for American Progress think tank, had maintained an active presence on Twitter, frequently criticizing GOP senators.
She has since deleted more than 1,000 tweets and apologized for her past remarks, although Senate Republicans repeatedly seized on her social media posts to criticize her fitness and temperament for the administration job.
Tanden had called Collins the worst and pathetic, and said vampires have more heart than Ted Cruz, referring to the GOP senator from Texas. Tanden has compared Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to Voldemort, the Harry Potter series villain, and called him Moscow Mitch.
In turn, Republican senators faced accusations of a double standard when it came to Tanden and her Twitter posts, considering how often they feigned ignorance about President Donald Trumps social media feeds during his administration. Trump regularly aimed furious insults at an array of people who angered him, including foreign leaders and Democratic lawmakers.
In recent days, attention had largely turned to Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who has been weighing whether to support Tanden and met with the nominee earlier this week. Murkowski had not announced her decision when Tanden withdrew Tuesday.
By the time her nomination was withdrawn, Tanden had held 46 meetings with senators, who were immediately lobbied by incoming administration and key advocacy groups once Biden announced her nomination in December.
Tanden had the endorsement of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and powerful labor unions such as the Communications Workers of America. She also had strong support from leaders and activists representing the Asian American community.
But Tanden, a longtime operative, had taken on any number of powerful figures on Capitol Hill. A centrist Democrat, she had also tangled in the past with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who now chairs one of the two Senate committees that took up her nomination.
Sanders was informed by the White House earlier Tuesday that Tanden would be withdrawing from the job, according to one aide familiar with the conversation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. Murkowski had reiterated earlier Tuesday that she remained undecided on Tanden.
Administration officials did not immediately indicate who Biden would nominate in lieu of Tanden, although senior Democrats have increasingly talked up Shalanda Young, who had initially been tapped as Tandens deputy at OMB. Young is a former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and has long been respected by senior Republicans as well as Democrats.
Just hours before the White House pulled Tanden's nomination, Young appeared before the Senate Budget Committee, where she won praise from Democrats and Republicans. GOP senators made it clear they would prefer her for the top OMB job.
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), the ranking Republican on the panel, heaped praise on Young and hinted at her potential elevation, telling her: Youll get my support, maybe for both jobs.
Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) was more blunt: You may be more than deputy.
While Republicans did not hide their support for her, Young was careful throughout the hearing to compliment Tanden, showing no signs of the impending withdrawal. She said that she and Tanden would make a great team if both of us were confirmed.
Democrats on the committee, too, lauded Young's work in Congress, but they remained united in supporting Tanden. 
If Biden taps Young for the top spot, several others could be considered for the deputy role, including Ann O'Leary, a longtime Hillary Clinton policy aide, and Sarah Bianchi, a longtime Biden policy aide.

Sam Stein and Alex Thompson,Neera Tanden’s OMB nomination failed. Her fallback plan remains a mystery.,Those close to Tanden expect she will have a role in the White House. But the West Wing is pretty full already.,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/03/neera-tanden-omb-fallback-plan-473440,https://static.politico.com/19/0a/4d8e28c9448db757eef13bfa5bf8/neera-tanden-ap.jpg,2021-03-03T23:09:39Z,"A Democrat close to the process also noted: The irony is [Rice] was put in that role because she probably couldnt get [Senate] confirmed.
Health care is where Tanden has made the strongest mark in her career, having served as an adviser to the Health and Human Services secretary during the Obama years. But theres no expectation that she will go in as a deputy at an agency, and the Covid task force is already stacked with big names far along in their work. 
Instead, the expectation among top Democrats is that Tanden will take on a senior adviser role, even though the White House is brimming with such folks: from Steve Ricchetti to Bruce Reed to Anita Dunn. As one Democratic official put it you make up some job. The question is, does she wanna take it? 
Both Tandens allies and those close to the White House believe she will, though neither thought that this was the gig shed get. 
Her failed nomination has drawn questions about the White Houses confirmation strategy. Individuals inside the administration were concerned, early on, that it would be a difficult fight, owing to Tandens partisan reputation. 
Her selection was driven by White House chief of staff Ron Klain, one of Tandens key allies inside Biden World. But a person closely involved with the OMB director deliberations said Klain also recommended others for the role, including Rep. Deb Haaland (who was, instead, nominated as Interior secretary), Jennifer Granholm (now confirmed as Energy secretary), and Cecilia Rouse (now confirmed as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers). 
Tanden had broad support from Bidens top advisers including from Biden himself, the person said. She had deep policy experience and had been helpful to the campaign by providing policy support. Her rolodex included many top Democrats personal cell phone numbers which she used to shore up support from the party, including the left-wing, early on. 
Transition officials say that she plunged into the outreach strategy, trying to line up the backing of not just senators but a number of outside groups and validators that ranged from AAPI groups, to unions, to former Republican Sen. Jeff Flake.While those groups supported her nomination, officials at some of the groups felt that the effort was disorganized and lacked a real war room. 
The White House believed that the votes would be there for Tanden to be confirmed, up until Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) announced his opposition to her nomination. A scramble ensued to not just find a Republican vote, but to ensure that no other caucusing Democrat followed Manchin's example. 
Two such Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Kirsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) signaled privately that they would support the nomination. Sanders own aides thought their boss was voting ""yes"" after the confirmation hearings. 
According to three sources familiar with the discussions, Sanders let the White House know that he would likely be a ""yes"" on Tanden. Two of those sources said Sinema had made clear that she would vote yes on Tanden if a Republican senator could be found to support her too. In other words, Sinema would not be the deciding vote. 
Sinemas office declined to comment. Sanders office did not return a request for comment. But their public silence during the heat of the confirmation fight did not go unnoticed. 
If they had come out and said were with her, they would have put more muscle in trying to get [Sen. Lisa] Murkowksi to confirm or maybe another TBD Republican, said a person close to the White House. 
For the White House, the big unknown was Murkowksi. The Alaska Republican was the one Republican who had not stated where she stood on Tandens nomination to head OMB. She and Tanden met on Monday. And though the two talked about Biden administration policy vis-a-vis Murkowskis home state of Alaska, Democratic officials stressed that there was never talk of a quid-pro-quo.
There was no hint of if you do this, I will do that, said the aforementioned White House adviser. She was not in that space. But she had been clear in the White House that there were some things she was looking for with respect to Alaska.
The conversation did not produce a breakthrough. Murkowski has not said whether she ever made up her mind on Tandens nomination. But at the White House, it became evident that there was no path forward. On Tuesday evening, Tanden, fearful that Republicans were in the words of one confidant ""bleeding [her nomination] slowly"" asked to have her name withdrawn. The president complied. 
On Wednesday, Murkowski was asked about her thinking. 
Did I ever make up my mind? Im only pausing because Im like: did you read the news? Shes withdrawn, she replied. I dont know why theres still interest in this story. I think Neera Tanden has been through a lot for several months now and were going to move on. In fairness, Im glad I had an opportunity to talk to her

In a statement on Tuesday evening, Biden said he had accepted Tandens request to withdraw her name from contention.

The statement did not specify what other role Tanden would take up in the Biden administration.
Republican Senators and some Democrats had raised opposition to Tandens nomination over tweets she sent during former President Donald Trumps time in office.
Tanden previously served as president of the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning think-tank, and was a former top Senate aide to 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
She had frequently criticised independent Senator Bernie Sanders and his supporters online.

NPR also reported that she also referred to Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell as Voldemort, the Harry Potter villain, among other tweets aimed at US legislators.
Her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said in a statement last month.
On Tuesday, the White House also shared the letter Tanden sent to Biden withdrawing her name from contention.
I appreciate how hard you and your team at the White House has worked to win my confirmation, she wrote.
Unfortunately, it now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities.
