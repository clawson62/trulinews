MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicos central bank on Wednesday gave a more optimistic view of economic growth and job creation for this year and next than previously forecast, but said the coronavirus pandemic still posed serious risks to the outlook.

In a quarterly report, the bank said its central scenario was that gross domestic product would expand by 4.8% in 2021 and by 3.3% in 2022, up from prior forecasts of 3.3% for 2021 and 2.6% growth for 2022 for Latin Americas No. 2 economy.
Mexicos economy suffered its steepest recession in almost 90 years in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic battered activity.
Nevertheless, Banxico, as the Bank of Mexico is known locally, noted that by the final three months of the year, the pace of recovery was stronger than anticipated.
The brighter forecasts for the economy are based on a higher growth base at the end of 2020 and from a stronger growth forecast for U.S. industrial activity, said Banxico.
However, over the near term that will be partially offset by greater economic weakness in early 2021, it said.
Central Bank Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon said the speed of economic recovery would vary from country to country, and would depend significantly on the rollout of vaccines against COVID-19 and the magnitude of economic stimulus measures.
Mexico has injected little stimulus and has struggled to get in deliveries of vaccines promised by pharmaceutical firms.
Taking questions on a virtual call, he said the bank would be paying close attention to the pace and impact of the U.S. recovery and other external factors as it weighed its options.
The pandemic remained a serious risk factor, he said.
All told, Banxico expected between 250,000 and 570,000 jobs paying social security benefits to be added this year, up from a forecast of 150,000-500,000 three months ago.","Mexico central bank paints rosier picture of economic recovery - Reuters Mexico's central bank on Wednesday gave a more optimistic view of economic growth and job creation for this year and next than previously forecast, but said the coronavirus pandemic still posed serious risks to the outlook.",Reuters,reuters,47,0.5574,"['mexico', 'central bank', 'economic']","[0.289, 0.288, 0.237]",0.2695961945634051

Gina Raimondo to serve as President Joe Bidens commerce secretary and help guide the economys recovery during and after the coronavirus pandemic.
The vote was 84-15.
Raimondo, 49, was the first woman elected governor of Rhode Island and is serving her second term. She is a Rhodes Scholar and a graduate of Yale Law School who went on to become a venture capitalist before turning to politics.
Raimondo will be responsible for promoting the nations economic growth domestically and overseas. 
Later Tuesday, the Senate voted 95-4 to confirm Cecilia Rouse to be chair of Bidens Council of Economic Advisers. Rouse will be the first Black woman to lead the CEA in its 74 years of existence.
Republican opposition to Raimondos confirmation focused on concerns that she would not be forceful enough in confronting the Chinese governments efforts to gain an economic and technological edge through espionage.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in particular said he was concerned that she declined during her confirmation hearing to commit to keeping Chinese telecom giant Huawei on the departments Entity List. U.S. companies need to get a license to sell sophisticated technology to companies on the list. 
She subsequently told senators she had no reason to believe that companies on the list should not be there. But that answer failed to satisfy Cruz. He said it would have been a simple matter for Raimondo to commit to keeping Huawei and others on the Entity List.
She refused to do so, repeatedly, Cruz said before the vote. This appears to be part of a pattern of a systemic decision to embrace communist China.
Biden has said China is in for extreme competition from the U.S. under his administration, but that the new relationship he wants to forge need not be one of conflict.
The COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in China, has also strained the relationship between the two countries with members of both U.S. political parties working to highlight any accommodations they see the other side making toward China.
Much of Raimondos work will be focused on regional economic issues. Lawmakers from coastal states want help protecting valuable fishing industries. Lawmakers from rural states want greater investment in broadband. She confirmed her interest in working with them on those issues during her confirmation hearing and emphasized the need to tackle climate change. She noted as governor that she oversaw construction of the nations first offshore wind farm. 
Were looking for someone who can come in and help, with private sector experience, to really move the agenda of this administration forward. So, for me, Gov. Raimondos private sector experience really means a lot, said Sen. Maria Cantwell, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. She knows how to invest in new technologies and things that are going to help us grow jobs for the future, and she knows how to match up a workforce with those job opportunities.
The Commerce Department comprises a dozen bureaus and agencies, including the National Weather Service, the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Raimondo would oversee the work of more than 40,000 employees.","Senate confirms Raimondo as Biden commerce secretary - The Associated Press <ol><li>Senate confirms Raimondo as Biden commerce secretary  The Associated Press

Opinion by Ed Morales,Biden is right about 'aliens',"With the Biden administration ending the use of the word ""alien"" when referring to undocumented immigrants in federal documents and communications, Ed Morales writes that the President is moving in the right direction.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/02/opinions/alien-federal-government-immigration-biden-morales/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210222150827-us-naturalization-ceremony-file-super-tease.jpg,2021-03-03T04:46:20Z,"Ed Morales (@SpanglishKid) is a journalist and lecturer at Columbia University's Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race and the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY. He's the author of the book ""Fantasy Island: Colonialism, Exploitation and the Betrayal of Puerto Rico."" The views expressed are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.
 (CNN)Last month, an email obtained by Axios revealed that Joe Biden's administration is encouraging the elimination of the use of the term ""alien"" or ""illegal alien"" in favor of ""undocumented individual"" or ""undocumented noncitizen"" in all official documents, outreach efforts and other communications, to describe those in the US who are not citizens. It's a significant development that is welcomed by advocates of the undocumented, since the long-standing use of ""alien"" is a not-so-subtle dog whistle that has been effectively used to dehumanize not only the undocumented, but actual American citizens. 
And it's also a reflection of the difficult task the Biden administration faces: appearing to be serious on protecting the border while at the same time restoring some humanity to immigration enforcement policy, a challenge Barack Obama's administration struggled with. Dispensing with the use of the terms ""alien"" and ""illegal"" could go a long way to lessening harm to those who are judged as ""not American"" because of their racial appearance.
But there is little question that it will be an uphill battle in this America.
While some triumphant Democrats argue that this signals a reversal of the relentless demonization of Mexican and Central American immigrants that Donald Trump so effectively channeled and advanced, that would be wishful thinking: the hostile stance assumed by the former president was not new in this country. The roots of his ""Build the Wall"" rhetoric and constituency can be traced back to recent events that preceded his tenure -- measures like California's Proposition 187 in 1994, for example, which made undocumented immigrants (""illegal aliens"" in the language of the ballot measure) ineligible for public benefits. 
In Arizona, propositions 100, 102 and 300, adopted in 2006, had varying effects: prohibiting ""alien"" bias in some cases, preventing them from filing civil suits, and denying them access to higher education, respectively. The state's SB 1070 (the ""papers please law""), passed in 2010, criminalized being an undocumented noncitizen and gave the green light to police officers to ask for proof of legal status for anyone they believed was in the country illegally. And other statutes, like the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act passed in 1996, and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security following 9/11, hardened immigration laws and their enforcement.
The term alien, as applied to migrants and others has a long history that dates back to English common law. Derived from the Latin alienus, meaning ""belonging to another,"" alien was used in England to describe someone ""born outside the kings' dominion's,"" an apparently neutral usage. But the use of the word in the US has evolved over time in the US to reflect different stages of the nation's history -- almost always reflecting racist discrimination. In the fledgling United States, the 1790 Naturalization Act limited naturalization to an ""alien"" who is a ""free white person."" 
Some historians point out that slaves brought to the US from outside the country after the international slave trade was banned in 1808 were the first ""illegal immigrants."" The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first legal restriction of immigration that targeted nonwhites, in this case Asians who were scapegoated during a period of economic crisis. Historian Mae Ngai argues in her bookImpossible Subjects that the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924 was ""the nation's first comprehensive restriction law,"" establishing ""for the first-time numerical limits on immigration and a global racial and national hierarchy that favored some immigrants over others."" 
By the mid-20th century, in popular culture, the caricature ""alien"" soared to new heights as part of the science-fiction genre, where the invocation of a cold, mysterious nonhuman ""other"" served as a metaphor for fear of menacing outsiders while the country was in the grips of 50s and 60s Cold War paranoia. While occasionally films like Steven Spielberg's ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind attempted to dispel the characterization, (aliens, in those films, were the good guys; officials were the bad guys) the aliens remained decidedly not human. It was Ridley Scott's Alien series that maintained the metaphor, representing aliens as stomach-exploding reptilian slime-things in deep space, where no one could hear you scream. With the menacing ""alien"" firmly implanted in America's subconscious, it's not that much of a stretch to the idea of an ""illegal alien"" threatening its neighborhoods.
Anti-immigrant sentiment began to grow after Mexican immigrants went from the fourth largest to the largest immigrant group in the US between 1970 and 1980, according to US Census Bureau data. ""Illegal alien"" took on a particularly dangerous, derisive meaning (one that became a building block in our present-day explosion of racial intolerance). The terrorist attacks in September 2001 placed many brown people in the US, Latinos among them, under suspicion -- about their citizenship status, their loyalty to the nation, and even their place in the country. This reinforced the way many Latinos in America had effectively become ""alien citizens,"" which Ngai describes as ""an American citizen by virtue of her birth in the United States but whose citizenship is suspect, if not denied.""
The elimination of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service in 2003, which previously operated under the Department of Justice, and its replacement with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (or ""ICE"") agency, operating within the newly created Department of Homeland Security, had effects like conflating immigration offenses with anti-terrorism and crime control, according to a Boston College legal journal. According to ""The Criminalization of Immigration,"" a 2015 report by the American Immigration Council (AIC) ""the government has been redefining what it means to be a 'criminal alien,' using increasingly stringent definitions of 'criminality that do not apply to US citizens.'"" 
A year before Trump was elected, AIC asserted that deportation efforts, stepped up during the Obama administration, cast ""a widening dragnet over the nation's foreign-born population in search of anyone who might be deportable."" Latinos had come under suspicion because of the way DHS lumped together enforcement against potential terrorists with that against those who violated immigration laws. Many in the Republican Party, such as former Texas Gov. Rick Perry in 2014, began to use rhetoric that implied terrorists were slipping into the US through the border with Mexico. ""Criminal aliens,"" he called them.
It's clear that the use of stereotyping phrases like ""illegal alien"" does more harm than just hurt feelings. And we've seen it played out on the media. The recently cancelled Fox News' Lou Dobbs, for instance, as far back as 2005, falsely claimed that immigrants crossing the border were spreading leprosy. And last month, when talking about the Covid-19 vaccine rollout in her state, Arizona Rep. Debbie Lesko said: ""I worked with people that are Hispanic. I mean they're very good workers... We're compassionate people, but for goodness sakes, we have to take care of American citizens, or people that are here legally, first."" Statements like these continue to smear Latinos as less than deserving. (Lesko later said that her remarks could be misinterpreted and that she meant that senior citizens should receive the vaccine before ""illegal immigrants."")
Even Latino US citizens face harm because of implicit bias in the criminal justice system that consistently leads to disproportionate arrest and sentencing. From Puerto Ricans -- American citizens -- born on their native island or in the 50 states to 5th generation Mexican American citizens to 3rd generation Salvadoran American citizens and on and on, many Americans are harmed by negative stereotypes when caught up in the system; some are even profiled by ICE as immigration law violators. 
That the Biden administration has shown concern about this is admirable -- the very intention of naming an immigrant from Cuba, Alejandro Mayorkas, as Secretary of Homeland Security, the first Latino at the helm of the agency, seems proof of that. While many Cubans in the first wave of exiles had an easier path to citizenship, and most are still favored by the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, the Krome Detention Center in Miami, a major ICE facility, was originally used to detain Cubans who came to the US in the 1980 Mariel Boatlift. Many of them were perceived as less desirable. And Obama ended the policy that allowed Cubans who arrived without a visa a direct path to permanent residency just before leaving office in 2017. More recently, Cubans have faced increased deportations and many who decided to enter through Mexico are still trapped waiting at the border.
Biden's newly announced US Citizenship Act of 2021 creates an eight-year path to citizenship and a new 5-year temporary status, as well as a quicker path for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients, known as Dreamers, for Temporary Protected Status immigrants, and a path to green-card status for farm workers is also promising. But a recently-released memo on interim guidance for civil immigration enforcement and removal priorities has raised concerns from immigration advocates. The document apparently intended to reduce immigration arrests and deportations by requiring higher levels of approval from senior managers. The American Civil Liberties Union issued a statement calling the memo a ""disappointing step backward,"" because, they say, the Biden administration ""has chosen to continue giving ICE officers significant discretion to conduct operations that harm our communities and tear families apart."" 
The Arizona-based political organizing group Mijente called it ""a step in the right direction,"" but one that ""excludes too many members of our communities... We have a long way to go.""
Since taking office, the Biden administration has halted construction on the border wall and moved to bring back immigrants who were forced to ""remain in Mexico,"" under a Trump administration policy. Yet thousands of unaccompanied migrant children continue being detained in government shelters. While in theory the Biden approach has a more humane vision, it needs to make sure its priorities and its actions match its language of compassion.","Biden is right about 'aliens' With the Biden administration ending the use of the word ""alien"" when referring to undocumented immigrants in federal documents and communications, Ed Morales writes that the President is moving in the right direction.",CNN,cnn,38,0.0,"['right', 'undocumented', 'biden', 'direction']","[0.346, 0.296, 0.286, 0.285]",0.2734667666867925

The tensions for now are mostly under the surface as the party approaches an initial victory under Biden: passage into law of a giant $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill.
The Senate is expected to pass it this week, and when it becomes law it will serve as an unmistakable victory in Bidens first 100 days.
Yet this initial victory will cover up for fears among Democrats that big-ticket items passed in the House will die in the Senate unless the party greases the gears for change by ending the filibuster.

I believe and I believe my caucus believes that we need big, bold action, and were going to figure out the best way to get big, bold action on a whole lot of fronts, Schumer  said, vowing that people are going to be forced to vote on them.
But the White House on Tuesday sought to avoid the issue in some ways: Biden didnt take questions from Democratic senators on Tuesday during a brief, eight-minute call to their weekly luncheon.
The call ended up serving as a pep rally ahead of the vote this week on the relief measure, but by taking no questions, Biden also avoided hearing from liberal senators about the filibuster or the push for a $15 minimum wage, which was included in the initial COVID-19 relief bill passed by the House early Saturday morning but is now on ice.
He said we need to pass this bill and pass it soon, Schumer told reporters after the call, referring to Biden. He said the Senate will have the votes we need to pass the bill and that Congress is on track to send the measure to Bidens desk before federal unemployment benefits expire on March 14.
Asked Tuesday if he would support filibuster reform if Republicans block Democratic priorities such as expanding protections for voting rights, Schumer answered: The bottom line is were going to figure out were going to come together as a caucus and figure out a way to get the bold action that the American people demand.
Liberal hopes for raising the federal minimum wage in the COVID-19 relief bill were dashed by a confluence of factors.
The Senate parliamentarian ruled raising the minimum wage couldnt be included under special budgetary rules that Democrats are using to sidestep the filibuster in the Senate. That led some Democrats to call for overruling the parliamentarian, a step rejected by Biden and Senate Democratic leaders.
It also masked the fact that Democrats in the Senate did not have 50 votes to pass the minimum wage hike advocated by the House because of opposition from Democratic Sen.

Progressives now want to build pressure on Biden to end the filibuster in the hopes it will add to the pressure on Manchin and other Democrats to do so.
Without Bidens support, however, liberal advocates for changing the rules of the Senate say theres no chance of convincing Manchin or Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) to back rules reform.

Theyre not going to feel pressure on themselves to do it unless Biden himself gives them that pressure, said Robert Borosage, co-founder of Campaign for Americas Future, a progressive advocacy group.
During Tuesdays conference call, Biden expressed strong support for raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, but he stopped well short of endorsing scrapping the filibuster.
He made clear to Democrats that he doesnt want any distractions from the effort to send $1,400 stimulus checks and other aid to American families and businesses. He did indicate that he plans to come back to the minimum wage fight.
Democrats expect pressure on lawmakers to repeal the filibuster to mount after the House passes H.R. 1, a sweeping campaign finance reform measure, and the John LewisJohn LewisVernon Jordan: an American legend, and a good friendGOP lawyer tells Supreme Court curtailing Sunday voting lawfulDOJ faces swift turnaround to meet Biden voting rights pledgeMORE Voting Rights Act, which are both expected to run into Senate filibusters.
Biden has so far held back from supporting filibuster reform in the Senate, even though he sees legislation to strengthen voting rights as a critical priority.

The presidents view on the filibuster is well known, she said. He has not changed that point of view but certainly any step to protect voting rights, to ensure that its easier and not harder for people to vote in the country, we feel is a positive step.

Warren on Tuesday said Biden right now is focused on signing the COVID-19 relief bill into law instead of how to maneuver around expected GOP filibusters on minimum wage legislation and other priorities.
Sanders after the call said there will be more efforts to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
Trust me, trust this will not be the last vote on minimum wage, Sanders said. There will be many votes. This minimum wage bill is going to pass.
Democratic senators who favor filibuster reform say the parliamentarians ruling striking the minimum wage provision from the COVID-19 relief package adds momentum to changing the Senate rules.  
I think that has played a role and I also think over time the impact of the dysfunction that has been driven by a particular handful of members filibustering everything has moved our caucus from being relatively split on changing things, reforming the filibuster, to be much more unified that some things have to happen, said Sen. Martin HeinrichMartin Trevor HeinrichDemocrats offer bill on Puerto Rico statehoodUSPS adding up to 165K fuel efficient or electric delivery vehiclesDemocrats propose executive actions on electric vehicle acquisitionsMORE (D-N.M.).
Heinrich said, The sort of filibuster usage we see makes it impossible to do some very basic things that the American people demanded of us.
Raising the minimum wage is one of those examples, he added.

The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated that 11.8 million fewer adults and 4.6 million fewer children would be eligible for the direct payments. Steve Wamhoff, the groups director of federal tax policy, said the changes in the Senate bill would not reduce eligibility for people in the bottom 60 percent of income.
Kyle Pomerleau, a resident fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, estimated that about 8.7 million fewer households would be eligible for direct payments under Senate Democrats agreement. He also estimated that the changes would reduce the cost of the overall bill by anywhere from $15 billion to $20 billion.
The IRS said it issued more than 160 million first-round payments last year, and almost 150 million second-round payments.
Senate Democrats this week reached an agreement to reduce the number of higher-income households that would qualify for partial payments, compared to the version of the bill that passed the House over the weekend. This change reflects a priority of moderates who wanted the payments to be more targeted to lower-income households.
Like the House-passed bill, individuals with income of up to $75,000 and married couples with income of up to $150,000 would be eligible for full payments of $1,400 in the Senate proposal. However, Senate Democrats now say fewer households above those thresholds will be eligible for partial payments. The Senate is slated to vote on the package later this week.
Under the House measure, individuals with income above $100,000 and married couples with income above $200,000 would be ineligible to receive any payments. Those cutoffs are lowered to $80,000 for single filers and $160,000 for married couples in Senate Democrats agreement.",Senate stimulus checks would reduce recipients by up to 16 million: analysis Senate Democrats' proposed changes to the cutoffs for stimulus checks in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus re...,The Hill,the-hill,27,0.0,"['stimulus check', 'senate', 'recipient']","[0.475, 0.312, 0.262]",0.2317238893098269
