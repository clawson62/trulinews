Six books by the children's author Dr. Seuss will no longer be published by Dr. Seuss Enterprises due to racist and insensitive content, the Associated Press reported on Monday.
The decision is being criticized by some who are not in favor of the author being posthumously ""canceled.""
The announcement was made Read Across America Day, which was also the late author's birthday.
""It's a responsible move on their part,"" Colbert said on Tuesday's installment of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.
""There hadn't been an earth-shattering outcry, but they recognize the impact these images might have on readers, especially kids, and they're trying to fix it because Dr. Seuss books should be fun for all people—Black, white, straight, gay, Sneetches both star-bellied and plain, Loraxes, Barb-a-loots, all the Whos down in Whoville and the strange, angry creature called Foo Foo the Snoo.
""It's especially important to be responsive like this,"" he added, ""because Dr. Seuss has also so many books that are lovely and teach kids vital lessons that resonate to this day.""
The six books which will cease to be published are And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, If I Ran the Zoo, McElligot's Pool, On Beyond Zebra!, Scrambled Eggs Super!, and The Cat's Quizzer.
In a statement, Dr. Seuss Enterprises told The Associated Press: ""These books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong. Ceasing sales of these books is only part of our commitment and our broader plan to ensure Dr. Seuss Enterprises' catalog represents and supports all communities and families.""
Some of the books have been criticized for depictions of Black people using racist stereotypes, as well as expressing a number of anti-Japanese sentiments.

Colbert also mocked the criticism of the move to ban the books, joking: ""The Dr. Seuss folks listened to criticism, thought it was reasonable and made what's called a change. Or as it's known on Fox News: cancel culture.""
Donald Trump Jr. was a conservative voice unhappy with the move, calling it ""absolutely insane.""
""What is going on? It's absolutely insane. We've lost our minds and we're encouraging it by allowing it,"" Trump said on Fox &amp; Friends.
Mocking Trump, Colbert joked: ""I'm not surprised Don Jr. loves The Cat in the Hat, I've always believed he can read at a second-grade level.

Ted Lieu (D-CA) has questioned how much Americans care about several Dr. Seuss books ceasing to be published and said the focus of Democrats is on passing more stimulus checks.
Six books by Dr. Seuss will no longer be published by Dr. Seuss Enterprises due to containing racist and insensitive imagery, the Associated Press reported on Monday—which was Read Across America Day, and also the late author's birthday.
In his Read Across America Day proclamation, Biden did not mention Dr. Seuss as previous presidents have in the past.
This situation has sparked some criticism on social media, including comments from several Republican lawmakers. They questioned what they deemed attempts to ""cancel"" Dr. Seuss.
Commenting on the situation on Twitter, Lieu wrote: ""Do ordinary Americans care about the 6 relatively unknown Dr. Seuss books that the publisher is no longer going to publish? No.
""That's why Dems are focused on stimulus checks. And since one of the Dr. Seuss books made fun of my ethnicity, I'm glad the free market cancelled it.""
His tweet was in response to a post from New York Times opinion columnist Ezra Klein, who questioned the GOP's reaction to the Dr. Seuss books situation coming as Democrats move to pass a $1.9 trillion relief bill.
Lieu similarly suggested the decision on the books ceasing to be published was down to ""the free market"" in a separate tweet.
In a statement, Dr. Seuss Enterprises told The Associated Press: ""These books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong. Ceasing sales of these books is only part of our commitment and our broader plan to ensure Dr. Seuss Enterprises' catalog represents and supports all communities and families.""
The six books which will cease to be published are And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, If I Ran the Zoo, McElligot's Pool, On Beyond Zebra!, Scrambled Eggs Super!, and The Cat's Quizzer.
Lieu's comments come as Democrats continue to push on with their COVID-19 relief plans using the reconciliation process, which could mean the measures get through without any Republican support.
The House passed a bill including a round of $1,400 stimulus checks last week. This will now be considered in the Senate, with debate on this due to begin this week.
Through the reconciliation process, this would only need a simple majority to pass the upper chamber. This means the Democrats could pass it without any Republican support, if its caucus is united behind the plans.
Newsweek has contacted Lieu's office for comment.

McCarthy made the remarks from the House floor while speaking against H.R. 1, the For the People Act, a voting rights bill introduced by Democrats. The company that owns the rights to works by Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, had announced on the same day that six of the children's books would not be republished due to racist images, but the books were not outlawed and Democrats were not involved in the decision.
""H.R. 1 rewrites election law and imposes one-size-fits-all partisan rules from Washington,"" McCarthy said. ""Under the Constitution, we generally defer to states and counties to run elections. Democrats want to change that. First they outlaw Dr. Seuss, and now they want to tell us what to say.""

McCarthy insisted that the bill would threaten free speech, likely due to provisions centered on disclosing political donors and spending, while also imperiling ""election integrity."" He asserted that ""everyone"" had a personal experience of themselves or someone they knew receiving a ballot in error while highlighting distrust in the election process.
""Everyone has a personal story: Your friend, your family, your neighbor receiving a ballot they shouldn't have,"" said McCarthy. ""Every one of those stories erodes the trust in election integrity. Yet, under H.R. 1, future voters could be dead, or illegal immigrants, or maybe even registered two or three times. I guess Democrats just don't care as long as they get reelected.""
H.R. 1 would not legalize voters registering more than once or casting multiple ballots, nor would it allow votes from non-citizens or dead people. Former President Donald Trump and some of his allies have claimed similar methods were used in an unsubstantiated claim of widespread voter fraud that allegedly resulted in President Joe Biden winning the 2020 election.
Neither Democrats nor the government had any role in the decision to drop the Dr. Seuss books. Dr. Seuss Enterprises, owner of the books, issued a statement on Tuesday announcing that it had made the decision to cease printing six out of over 60 books last year, based on ""hurtful and wrong"" portrayals of people in the books.
""Dr. Seuss Enterprises, working with a panel of experts, including educators, reviewed our catalog of titles and made the decision last year to cease publication and licensing of the following titles: And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, If I Ran the Zoo, McElligot's Pool, On Beyond Zebra!, Scrambled Eggs Super!, and The Cat's Quizzer,"" the statement reads. ""These books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong.""
""Ceasing sales of these books is only part of our commitment and our broader plan to ensure Dr. Seuss Enterprises's catalog represents and supports all communities and families,"" it adds.

Mast, who represents Florida's 18th congressional district, shared a photo of himself on Twitter reading one of Dr. Seuss' books to his young children on the floor of a bedroom.
""The works of Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known to us as Dr. Seuss, have sparked a love for reading in generations of students. His whimsical wordplay and curious characters inspire children to dream big,"" Mast wrote, tagging the former president.
The quote comes from Obama's 2015 Read Across America Day proclamation.
Obama offered similar praise in his 2014 proclamation, saying: ""Countless Americans can recall his books as their first step into the lands of letters and wordplay. With creatures, contraptions, and vibrant characters, they have led generations of happy travelers through voyages of the imagination.""
Established by National Education Association in 1998, the event falls on Geisel's birthday and has typically been closely linked with celebrations of him and his books.
However, in recent years Read Across America Day has moved away from an emphasis on Geisel because some of his works featured racially insensitive depictions, especially of Asian and Black people.
Conservatives—including elected Republicans—have recently weighed into the debate about Geisel's legacy and accused some on the left of trying to ""cancel"" the popular author.

The controversy about Geisel and so-called ""cancel culture"" appears to stem in part from rumors that public schools in Loudoun County, Virginia were banning Geisel's books outright. This was not the case and the schools publicly refuted the claim.
Dr. Seuss Enterprises, the company that manages Geisel's legacy, has also announced it will cease publication of six lesser-known books by the author because of their insensitive depictions.
The books in question are If I Ran the Zoo, Scrambled Eggs Super, McElligot's Pool, And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street, The Cat's Quizzer and On Beyond Zebra!
""These books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong,"" Dr. Seuss Enterprises said in a statement. ""Ceasing sales of these books is only part of our commitment and our broader plan to ensure Dr. Seuss Enterprises' catalog represents and supports all communities and families.""

Scott Huler,"No, Dr. Seuss Wasn't 'Canceled.' Enough With the Hysteria About Cancel Culture | Opinion","If you imagine that the people whose very lives focus on the legacy of Dr. Seuss are canceling Dr. Seuss, you have lost track of what cancel culture is.",https://www.newsweek.com/no-dr-seuss-wasnt-canceled-enough-hysteria-about-cancel-culture-opinion-1573628,https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1748140/dr-seuss.jpg,2021-03-03T23:13:11Z,"We were already thinking about Dr. Seuss. On February 26, The Daily Wire informed readers that a Virginia school district was disconnecting its observance of Read Across America Day from Seuss, citing possible racist undertones in his work. ""Dr. Seuss Canceled,"" the headline said. Much more arresting was Tuesday's news that Dr. Seuss Enterprises had decided to cease publication of six of the good Doctor's works because the books contained racist images they could not defend.
The backlash from the right was immediate and intense, and at first, I admit I, too, was skeptical. One of my favorites was on the list of canceled books, And to Think I saw it on Mulberry Street, a book I'd always thought of as having a very wholesome message about balancing celebrating your imagination while also committing to reality. So in light of the news, I went and found a copy—and immediately had my heart broken.
As you may recall, the book has its protagonist trying hard to turn ""a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street"" into something worth reporting to his father. In his imagination, the horse turns to a zebra, a reindeer, and eventually an elephant, with a rajah riding atop. And then, he finds ""a Chinese man, who eats with sticks,"" wears a conical hat, has little slanted lines for eyes and runs on wood-block clogs. If you remember Charlie from the Mr. Magoo cartoons, you'll recognize the level of stereotype.
Looking that image, it was impossible not to recognize that Dr. Seuss Enterprises had done the right thing. This is not cancel culture, as the right would have you believe; this is living forward through time. This is learning and growing. This is how you manage a legacy.
And here's the interesting thing: In original editions of the book, the character was even more offensively stereotypical and was referred to as ""a Chinaman."" Later in his life, Seuss became aware of the problem and redrew the character. He also expressed regret over racist stereotypes he used in his early political cartoons. Once the author is dead, though, there's only so far you can go. So if you're in charge of a legacy, you grow and learn. Occasionally, you put aside something you can no longer defend and you support the enormous treasure of the rest.

And that is exactly what's happening here. For Dr. Seuss has hardly been canceled. The man published some sixty books, during a period when the United States practiced Jim Crow segregation, interned Japanese citizens during World War II, and engaged in almost ceaseless cultural and racist stereotyping. That more than 90 percent of Seuss's work is still considered not merely acceptable but laudable is a triumph, not a cancellation.
Books aren't being withdrawn (though librarians have long replaced some they thought didn't work). Books aren't being impounded. A copyright holder has said it will no longer publish books it recognizes have problematic elements.
If you imagine that the people whose very lives focus on the legacy of Dr. Seuss are canceling Dr. Seuss, you have lost track of what cancel culture is.
And maybe that's the point. Cancel culture is mostly whatever someone says it is, usually someone threatened by some criticism. That is, calling something ""cancel culture"" is just the current way of bemoaning ""political correctness,"" which is itself just a replacement for ""I'm just kidding,"" which in turn replaced ""Can't you take a joke?"" which is the traditional cry of the bully and is code for ""Shut up and take it or I'll pound you."" Or arrest you, or intern you, or deport you, or whatever powers the threatened, ""canceled"" entity controls.
Complaints about cancel culture really express the fear that culture is moving forward, growing, progressing. People who believe their culture peaked at some hazy moment in the past find change terrifying. They feel canceled and rendered invisible when people criticize cultural icons. In this case Dr. Seuss Enterprises looks not to the past but to the present, and to the future. Some of Dr. Seuss's books engage in stereotyping that renders actual people invisible. His estate has decided to stop doing that. Dr. Seuss is wonderful, a treasure. But he wasn't perfect. Perfect is a fantasy; Dr. Seuss Enterprises is choosing reality.
You might say that those who complain about cancel culture have trouble distinguishing between the fantasy they prefer and the mundane and sometimes complex reality they fear. Crying ""cancel culture!"" offers a fantastic, if imaginary, parade down Bliss Street. The mundane reality that Dr. Seuss was as flawed as the rest of us and those in charge of his legacy are thoughtfully managing it?

""Erasing books is insanity,"" the website says. ""Stand up for our common humanity.""
The Banned Seuss website currently features And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, one of the six books from the author that will no longer be reprinted, in full.
The website links to the Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism's site, a non-partisan organization that claims to be ""dedicated to advancing civil rights and liberties for all Americans.""
""Increasingly, American institutions—colleges and universities, businesses, government, the media, and even our children's schools—are enforcing a cynical and intolerant orthodoxy.

""It pits us against one another and diminishes what it means to be human,"" the foundation added.

A spokesperson for Dr. Seuss Enterprises told the Associated Press on Tuesday that six books will no longer be reprinted due to their racist and insensitive imagery.
""These books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong,"" Dr. Seuss Enterprises said. ""Ceasing sales of these books is only part of our commitment to and our broader plan to ensure Dr. Seuss Enterprises' catalog represents and supports all communities and families.""
The six books that will no longer be reprinted are And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, If I Ran the Zoo, McElligot's Pool, On Beyond Zebra!, Scrambled Eggs Super!, and The Cat's Quizzer.
The announcement came on Read Across America Day, which also happens to be the late author's birthday.
Dr. Seuss, born Theodor Seuss Geisel, is one of the best-known children's book authors. He is behind such classics as The Cat in the Hat, Green Eggs and Ham, and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, among others.
Geisel, however, has a history of publishing racist and anti-Semitic work, according to a 2019 study published by the academic journal, Research on Diversity in Youth Literature.
The study examined 50 books by Geisel and found that 43 out of the 45 characters of color featured in those books have ""characteristics aligning with the definition of Orientalism,"" or the stereotypical and offensive portrayals of Asia.
The study then notes the two ""African"" characters both have anti-Black characteristics. The study describes anti-Blackness as discrimination, opposition or hostility against Blackness and Black people.
The move to stop reprinting the six Dr. Seuss' books has since been criticized by some and praised by others.
Donald Trump Jr., the former President Donald Trump's eldest son, called ""canceling"" the books ""absolutely insane"" during a Tuesday appearance on Fox News' Fox &amp; Friends.
Late-night talk show host Stephan Colbert, however, called the decision ""responsible"" on Tuesday.

It broke its fundamental promise to them, and now all the right can do is wallow in its defeat.
It may not be a coincidence that this spectacularly inane culture war outburst is happening at a moment when Democrats are about to pass a covid relief bill that looks to be one of the most popular pieces of major legislation in history. In this poll from Morning Consult, for instance, 77 percent of Americans say they support it, as do 59 percent of Republicans.
Thats extraordinary, given that it got zero Republican votes in the House and will likely get zero in the Senate. Ordinarily, partisans follow the lead of their elites but not on this issue.
So if the conservative base wont get mad about President Bidens first legislative initiative, what can they get worked up about? Dr. Seuss.
In case you missed the emergence of this vital national issue, Dr. Seuss Enterprises announced that it will allow six of the authors lesser-known books to go out of print, because they contain imagery and language that just about everyone should acknowledge is disturbingly racist.
To be clear: There have been no anti-Seuss laws passed, no public campaigns to denounce Dr. Seuss, no boycotts, no books burned or banned, no cancelling, and no one saying that everyone should stop reading the many Dr. Seuss books that dont contain racist imagery. It was the decision of a publisher to no longer publish a few books that most people had never heard of, the kind of decision publishers make every day.
But it set off an explosion in the conservative media, egged on by political leaders who have been consumed with the terrifying threat posed by cancel culture.
So rather than seeing this as an interesting example of how the portrayal of racial minorities has changed for the better in recent decades, conservatives again rushed to proclaim themselves victims. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Democrats want to outlaw Dr. Seuss"" as part of a broader campaign to tell us what to say. Glenn Beck told his listeners that were seeing ""the end of freedom in America.
To repeat, no books have been banned or outlawed. But on Fox News, they treated the Dr. Seuss controversy like it was the most newsworthy event since the moon landing. Matthew Gertz of Media Matters for America counted 139 mentions of Dr. Seuss on the network on Tuesday alone, including a blazing rant from Tucker Carlson.
When the people in charge cancel Dr. Seuss, Carlson proclaimed, what theyre really trying to eliminate is a very specific kind of midcentury American culture, a culture that championed meritocracy and color blindness and the superiority of individual achievement over tribal identity.
That Carlson didnt burst out laughing while he presented that pile of manure to viewers he plainly views as half-witted rubes is a tribute to his professionalism as a performer. On Wednesday the wall-to-wall Seuss coverage on Fox has continued.
So why do I say this is proof that the Trump presidency failed? Because Trumpism was based on the idea that the trends and developments in American society its supporters find disturbing and disorienting could be reversed. America could be Made Great Again in other words, made like it was when you were younger and people like you were on top, their cultural, political, and economic hegemony unchallenged.
We already know that contemporary conservatism is built on proclaiming and feeling victimized. But whats so striking about the latest brand of culture war controversy is that it cultivates a sense of fundamentally unsolvable victimhood. There is no way out of it; all you can do is get angry and stay angry.
There are plenty of conservative identity issues for which thats not the case. If I tell you Biden is coming for your guns, for instance, what can you do? You can work to elect Republicans who will protect and expand gun rights. Theres a plausible path to both empowerment and defeating the threat, through the political system.
But what are you supposed to do about a culture that has rejected you and your values? Theres not much you can do, other than complain about it and marinate in your alienation.
And it goes beyond books you imagine are being banned (even if they arent). Trump was in office for four years, and all the immigrants were not banished; America continues to grow more diverse by the day. More Confederate monuments were taken down in 2020 than ever before. Women and minorities keep getting more positions of leadership. Kids still listen to music their parents hate. Liberals still control popular culture. Trump couldnt change any of that.
That doesnt mean the Republican Party is in a bad position, or that it wont win more victories in the future. But conservatives have immersed themselves in a cultural Lost Cause, defined by a defeat that cannot be undone.
