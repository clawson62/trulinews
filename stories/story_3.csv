In a letter to Biden released shortly before 7 p.m. on Tuesday, Tanden said she was withdrawing as ""it now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities.""
In response, Biden released a statement saying he had accepted her request.
""I have the utmost respect for her record of accomplishment, her experience and her counsel, and I look forward to having her serve in a role in my Administration. She will bring valuable perspective and insight into our work,"" Biden said.
Tanden's nomination had been controversial from the beginning. Figures from both sides of the aisle see her as a divisive figure, with Republicans disliking her for her outspoken partisanship and the left wing of the Democratic Party viewing her as an obstacle to progressive change in the country.
A prolific tweeter, Tanden's combative tweets about Senate Republicans and Senator Bernie Sanders became the center of attention during her confirmation hearing as lawmakers confronted the Hillary Clinton loyalist for attacking them.
""Just to mention a few of the thousands of negative public statements, you wrote that Susan Collins is the worst, that Tom Cotton is a fraud, that vampires have more heart than Ted Cruz. You called leader McConnell: Moscow Mitch and Voldemort, and on and on,"" GOP Senator Rob Portman of Ohio told Tanden during the hearing.
""Your attacks were not just made against Republicans,"" Sanders added the next day. ""There were vicious attacks against progressives, people who I have worked with, me personally.""
Three years ago, Tanden tweeted that ""Russia did a lot more to help Bernie than the DNC's random internal emails did to help Hillary.""
Neera Tanden, nominee for director of the Office of Management and Budget, testifies at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Budget Committee on February 10, at the U.S. Capitol. Tanden withdrew her nomination on Tuesday.Pool
Sanders supporters have long had a problem with Tanden, who was accused of punching his 2000 campaign manager in the chest when he worked the progressive news website ThinkProgress. Leaked emails from WikiLeaks also showed that Tanden had called ThinkProgress staffers ""crazy leftists"" in a series of emails.
Before the hearing, Tanden deleted thousands of tweets slamming senators—a move criticized by many during the confirmation process.
""Ms. Tanden's decision to delete more than a thousand tweets in the days before her nomination was announced raises concerns about her commitment to transparency,"" Collins said in a Monday statement announcing her decision to vote against Tanden. ""Should Congress need to review documents or actions taken by OMB, we must have confidence that the Director will be forthcoming.""
Tanden's withdrawal means Biden will have to go back to the drawing board and pick another nominee to lead the agency, further stalling what has been one of the slowest rates of Cabinet confirmations in the past 60 years.
While Biden's predecessor also struggled to confirm his own Cabinet, Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton had most of their full slate in place after their first week in office.
Just shy of 30 days in office, only seven of Biden's 23 Cabinet picks have been confirmed by the Senate.","Neera Tanden Bows Out of Confirmation Process in Stinging Defeat for White House ""It now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities,"" Tanden wrote.",Newsweek,newsweek,46,0.1779,"['confirmation', 'consideration', 'seems', 'neera tanden']","[0.424, 0.234, 0.221, 0.221]",0.2812992990920257

Tanden's nomination was highly controversial, with members from both sides of the political aisle having called her a divisive figure from the beginning.
In a Tuesday statement, Biden confirmed that he accepted Tanden's request to withdraw her name from nomination for Director of the OMB.
""I have the utmost respect for her record of accomplishment, her experience and her counsel, and I look forward to having her serve in a role in my Administration,"" he said.

Tanden withdrew her nomination in a letter to Biden, where she said ""it now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation.""
""I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities,"" she wrote. ""I appreciate how hard you and your team at the White House has worked to win my confirmation.""
As a prolific tweeter, Tanden's hostile posts about Bernie Sanders and his supporters, as well as SenateRepublicans, drew significant attention at her confirmation hearings as senators grilled the Hillary Clinton loyalist for her previous attacks against them—which she made while serving as head of the Center for American Progress.
Among them, referring to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as ""Voldemort,"" Tom Cotton as ""a fraud"" and Ted Cruz as someone that has less heart than a vampire.
Some conservatives celebrated Tanden's withdrawal, despite her having expressed regret for the language that she had previously used to attack people during her confirmation hearing.
Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said, ""Neera Tanden is a hyper-partisan bomb-thrower who doesn't have the votes. Now that Washington is done talking about Tanden's tweets, the Senate should focus on Xavier Becerra's assault on the First Amendment. We don't need a culture war super-soldier leading HHS.""
""Maybe @neeratanden can be the White House Social Media Director now? She's awfully good at tweeting,"" tweeted Mike Hahn, deputy digital director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC).
Far-right political commentator Dinesh D'Souza said, ""Neera Tanden bites the dust. Couldn't have happened to a nastier individual. Well, I guess she can go back to viciously slandering all the people who refused to support her.""

The bad blood between Tanden and supporters of Sanders started early. Tanden was accused of punching his campaign manager Faiz Shakir in the chest in 2008, when he worked at the left-wing news website ThinkProgress. She also once called staffers at the publication ""crazy leftists.""
Progressive opposition to her confirmation also reflects the deep ideological divisions in the Democratic party. The left wing believes Tanden to be an establishment figure who would maintain the status quo and act as as a roadblock to real progress in the country.
""I think our country would be served well by Shalanda Young,"" tweeted Michigan Representative Rashida Tlaib.
The Gravel Institute, a progressive think tank, tweeted, ""Neera Tanden just withdrew her nomination for OMB chair. You do love to see it.""

Murkowski also noted that White House officials never directly asked how she would vote.
I never did, they never asked, she said when asked if she ever told the White House how she would vote on the nominee.
Now she will be spared what could have been a difficult decision after she met with Tanden Monday and carefully walked the nominee through the various issues facing Alaska and the impact of Bidens seven executive actions on her home state.
Now it means Im going to have to do the Alaska tutorial 101 all over again with whoever it is that they name because I need this person to understand our challenges, she said of Bidens next pick to head the budget office.
Its possible that Tanden decided to withdraw her nomination because of additional opposition from Democrats such as centrist Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) or skepticism from Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie SandersBernie SandersOn The Money: Senators push for changes as chamber nears vote on .9T relief bill | Warren offers bill to create wealth tax Sanders vows to force vote on minimum wageNo. 2 Senate Democrat shoots down overruling parliamentarian on minimum wageMORE (I-Vt.), who said last week that the nominee didnt appear to have the votes to secure confirmation.

Democrats control a 50-50 Senate because Vice President Kamarla Harris has the tie-breaking vote.
As a result Democrats usually can't afford any defections but Biden officials had some hope last week that Murkowski could be persuaded to vote for Tanden to make up for Manchin's ""no"" vote.
But Tanden's nomination suffered another setback when the Senate Budget and Homeland Security Committees cancelled scheduled votes.
It was kind of going that relation last week when they moved those two committee hearings, Murkowski said of last weeks postponement of two committee meetings to vote on Tanden.
I dont think she thought she was going to be pulled, Murkowski said, based on her conversation with the nominee during a sit-down meeting Monday.
Murkowski said she went into that meeting with an open mind and turned the session into Alaska 101 in which they discussed issues ranging from why the Centers for Disease Control was important for getting movement on a conditional no-sale order to every project that comes up with what were doing with murdered, missing and indigenous women.
The Alaska senator said he gave Tanden the courtesy of a conversation as I do with just about every nominee who asks for one.
Shes really a smart woman, Ill tell you that, she said of Tanden.
Asked if she asked the administration for any specific concessions such as on oil and gas drilling in Alaska, Murkowski said she has made extensive efforts to educate Biden administration officials and potential officials about the numerous federal land restrictions affecting her state.
I show you the map about my roadless areas, she said. I go through all of the land management structure and say this is the challenge I have with my state right now, noting the pause Biden has imposed on oil and gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.
But Murkowski said she didnt ask for any quid pro quo or commitment from the White House in exchange for backing Tanden.
If youre asking [did I ask,] If I do this, will you do that? No, she said.
Instead, Murkowski is walking nominees such as Tanden and Bidens choice for attorney general, Merrick GarlandMerrick Brian GarlandJudiciary Committee greenlights Garland's AG nominationWatch live: Senate panel votes on Biden's attorney general nomineeThis week: Senate takes up coronavirus relief after minimum wage setbackMORE, through the issues facing her state and asking, What can you do to help me?
Weve got an industry that is really in a fragile position right now because of the administrations executive orders, she said of Bidens orders on oil and gas drilling. We need some focus, we need some attention.
I said to Tanden, Look the North Slope Area, this is called the National Petroleum Reserve for a reason. This is where we get x-percent of our revenues and walked her through many of the challenges we have, she added.
Murkowski noted that Tanden generated her own level of controversy because of her leadership of the progressive think tank, the Center for American Progress, and the very public-focused tweets in which she criticized senators, sometimes harshly.
But the GOP senator said she wasnt going to automatically dismiss the nominee.
I said, no I think its important to talk to her, she said.

Total U.S. coronavirus deaths reported each morning this week: Monday, 513,091; Tuesday, 514,657; Wednesday, 516,608.
The Senate will officially kick off consideration of the Biden administrations $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package as party leaders urge Senate Democrats to stick together and Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) predicts that they will have the votes to pass the massive bill.

President Biden made his pitch today to our entire caucus. And he said we need to pass this bill and pass it soon, Schumer told reporters after the call. 
As The Hills Jordain Carney writes, the rest of the week will be a test of will for the conference as it will take an initial vote to proceed to the House-passed coronavirus bill. The real challenge will come later in the week when the Senate endures a wide-ranging vote-a-rama, forcing Democrats to fend off challenges from GOP senators who will need to win over a single Democratic senator to alter the bill. The tight margin also gives leverage to any Senate Democrat who wants to make changes to the massive package. 
It means many long nights and many amendments that, frankly, don't go to the heart of the issue but are attempts to divert to some other political question, said Senate Majority Whip Dick DurbinDick DurbinBiden coronavirus relief bill tests narrow Democratic majorityHillicon Valley: Senate confirms Biden Commerce secretary pick Gina Raimondo | Wray hints at federal response to SolarWinds hack | Virginia governor signs comprehensive data privacy lawWray hints at federal response to SolarWinds hackMORE(D-Ill.) about the upcoming vote-a-rama and lead-up to a vote on the final bill.
Schumer, however, expressed confidence about the conferences ability to weather the coming storm. Speaking on the Senate floor, the New York Democrat insisted that Democrats will have the votes we need to pass this bill.
The Hill: Despite vows of unity and boasts of resolve, Democrats are sniping with one another about policy while Republican lawmakers brawl over Trump.
Meanwhile, the looming inability to pass the broader Democratic agenda is threatening to create problems for the president and party lawmakers after they vowed to enact a bold set of proposals if handed the keys to government. The political world on Capitol Hill post-COVID-19 package could be blown to smithereens, with Democratic bills on immigration, election reform and voting and gun rights set to join the legislative graveyard that Democrats derided throughout the 116th Congress (The Hill). 
This potential Democratic nightmare is bringing another discussion to the forefront: a renewed effort to eliminate the legislative filibuster. Progressives are clamoring for the 60-vote threshold to be nixed, but the likelihood of that becoming reality is slim to none because Sen. Joe ManchinJoseph (Joe) ManchinMurkowski never told White House she would oppose TandenOn The Money: Tanden withdraws nomination as Biden budget chief | Relief bill tests narrow Democratic majority | Senate confirms Biden's picks for Commerce, top WH economistTanden withdraws nomination as Biden budget chiefMORE (D-W.Va.) maintains that he will not support its undoing.

The president was forced to concede he could not muster sufficient votes for a nominee criticized for denigrating Republican and some Democratic senators for years on Twitter and during television commentary. 
Biden is expected to appoint Tanden, president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, to a position that does not require Senate confirmation. I have the utmost respect for her record of accomplishment, her experience and her counsel, and I look forward to having her serve in a role in my administration, Biden said in a statement.  
The Hill: Tanden withdraws her nomination.
Tanden would have needed the support of at least one Republican to overcome the no vote promised by Manchin, who said he believed Tanden could not be a unifying influence in that role.

She later said the White House never asked her how shed vote and that she was surprised Tandens nomination was pulled (The Hill). 
Elsewhere in the Senate on Tuesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray (pictured below) testified that officials classified the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol as domestic terrorism perpetrated by extremists. That attack, that siege, was criminal behavior, plain and simple, and its behavior that we, the FBI, view as domestic terrorism, Wray told lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee (The Hill).
Under questioning from lawmakers, Wray resisted pinning the Capitol breach on a single extremist ideology, saying the group of attackers included a variety of backgrounds. 
The attackers on Jan. 6 included a number and the number keeps growing as we build out our investigations of what we would call militia violent extremism, said Wray, who is a holdover from the Trump administration.
We have had some already arrested who we would put in the category of racially motivated violent extremism, white as well, he continued.
Wray clarified that the FBI has no evidence of antifa or left-wing, anti-fascist involvement in the siege (The Hill).

LEADING THE DAY
CORONAVIRUS: Biden on Tuesday announced that the administration has struck a deal with Merck &amp; Co. to help produce doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, boosting the U.S.s vaccine production to allow every American to receive a shot by the end of May. 
The president pointed to a stepped-up process under his administration that will bump up the vaccine production and distribution timeline by two months. 
Were now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May, Biden said in remarks from the White House on Tuesday afternoon. When we came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America. We rectified that.
Biden said that he has invoked the Defense Production Act to equip Merck facilities to safely manufacture the vaccine. Johnson &amp; Johnson plans to operate its facilities 24 hours a day, seven days a week in order to meet the increased supply in the expedited time frame (The Hill). 
It was not immediately clear how many more doses Merck will be able to make or when they will be available (The Hill).
The Wall Street Journal: Stock futures rise on vaccine, stimulus hopes.
&gt; State Watch, COVID-19 edition: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) announced on Tuesday that the Lone Star State is lifting most of its restrictions, including a statewide mask mandate, and will allow all businesses to reopen at 100 percent capacity starting on March 10.
Texans have mastered the daily habits to avoid getting COVID, Abbott said. Make no mistake, COVID has not suddenly disappeared. COVID still exists in Texas, in the United States and across the globe. But it is clear from the recoveries, the vaccinations, the reduced hospitalizations and the safe practices that Texans are using that state mandates are no longer needed.
The two-term governor also pointed to increasing vaccination rates Texas has vaccinated 5.7 million people, nearly 20 percent of the state population and a low statewide positivity rate as additional justification (The Hill). 
The Texas Tribune: Abbott says he's rescinding statewide mask mandate and capacity limits on businesses.
The Associated Press: Texas and other states ease COVID-19 rules despite warnings.
Shortly after the announcement, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) revealed that his state will follow suit, with restrictions and mask mandates being rescinded starting today. 
Starting tomorrow, we are lifting all of our county mask mandates and businesses will be able to operate at full capacity without any state-imposed rules. Our hospitalizations and case numbers have plummeted, and the vaccine is being rapidly distributed, Reeves tweeted. It is time!
NPR: Mississippi today will lift its mask requirement and its business capacity limits.
In Philadelphia, health officials announced on Tuesday that the city is easing restrictions to allow fans to attend indoor and outdoor sporting events. Indoor events will be capped at 15 percent capacity, and outdoor events will be capped at 20 percent capacity. The Wells Fargo Center, home to the NBAs Philadelphia 76ers and the NHLs Philadelphia Flyers, will reopen to fans on Sunday (CBS Philly).

POLITICS: Its never too early to ponder who the next Republican presidential nominee will be, and governors are in the pandemic spotlight.

DeSantiss approach earned him broad support among conservatives now in search of a 2024 standard-bearer and possible Trump successor, reports The Hills Julia Manchester. Trump easily won Florida and its 29 electoral votes in November, but Biden captured the White House with key victories in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. GOP support for DeSantis was on full view at last weekends Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando.
And speaking of Trump, only 68 percent of CPAC respondents said in a straw poll that they want Trump to run again for president, despite their strong support for his policies. The Hills Niall Stanage asks whether the 45th president, as Trump likes to be called, is experiencing a slow fade from national relevance.

&gt; RIP:Vernon Jordan Jr., a civil rights leader, power broker, businessman, Democratic Party donor and adviser to presidents, including former President Clinton, died on Monday at his home in Washington at age 85 (The New York Times). More than two decades ago at a White House gathering, Clinton paid tribute to civil rights leaders and icons in the legal community who helped mend what he called Americas social fabric.

&gt; In Texas, Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson, who previously served in the White House as Trumps physician before retiring from the Navy, is facing scathing allegations in a report drawn from a Defense Department inspector general investigation initiated in 2018. The report, reflecting information from 78 witnesses and White House documents, says Jackson made ""sexual and denigrating"" comments about a female subordinate, violated the policy for drinking alcohol while on a presidential trip and took prescription-strength sleeping medication that prompted concerns from his colleagues about his ability to provide proper care (CNN). Jackson briefly was Trumps choice to lead the Veterans Affairs Department before his nomination was withdrawn. The Washington Post in 2018 compiled an annotated list of allegations documented against Jackson when he was considered for a Cabinet post.

She will bring valuable perspective and insight to our work.
Tanden is incredibly grateful for your leadership on behalf of the American people and for your agenda that will make such a transformative difference in peoples lives, she told Biden.
Her nomination began to collapse last month when Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said he would oppose Tanden for the post, citing her past remarks targeting Republicans. That meant she would need at least one Republican vote to be confirmed in the 50-50 Senate, but potential swing votes including Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) also said they would not back her.
Tanden, a veteran political operative who most recently led the liberal Washington-based Center for American Progress think tank, had maintained an active presence on Twitter, frequently criticizing GOP senators.
She has since deleted more than 1,000 tweets and apologized for her past remarks, although Senate Republicans repeatedly seized on her social media posts to criticize her fitness and temperament for the administration job.
Tanden had called Collins the worst and pathetic, and said vampires have more heart than Ted Cruz, referring to the GOP senator from Texas. Tanden has compared Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to Voldemort, the Harry Potter series villain, and called him Moscow Mitch.
In turn, Republican senators faced accusations of a double standard when it came to Tanden and her Twitter posts, considering how often they feigned ignorance about President Donald Trumps social media feeds during his administration. Trump regularly aimed furious insults at an array of people who angered him, including foreign leaders and Democratic lawmakers.
In recent days, attention had largely turned to Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who has been weighing whether to support Tanden and met with the nominee earlier this week. Murkowski had not announced her decision when Tanden withdrew Tuesday.
By the time her nomination was withdrawn, Tanden had held 46 meetings with senators, who were immediately lobbied by incoming administration and key advocacy groups once Biden announced her nomination in December.
Tanden had the endorsement of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and powerful labor unions such as the Communications Workers of America. She also had strong support from leaders and activists representing the Asian American community.
But Tanden, a longtime operative, had taken on any number of powerful figures on Capitol Hill. A centrist Democrat, she had also tangled in the past with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who now chairs one of the two Senate committees that took up her nomination.
Sanders was informed by the White House earlier Tuesday that Tanden would be withdrawing from the job, according to one aide familiar with the conversation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. Murkowski had reiterated earlier Tuesday that she remained undecided on Tanden.
Administration officials did not immediately indicate who Biden would nominate in lieu of Tanden, although senior Democrats have increasingly talked up Shalanda Young, who had initially been tapped as Tandens deputy at OMB. Young is a former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and has long been respected by senior Republicans as well as Democrats.
Just hours before the White House pulled Tanden's nomination, Young appeared before the Senate Budget Committee, where she won praise from Democrats and Republicans. GOP senators made it clear they would prefer her for the top OMB job.
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), the ranking Republican on the panel, heaped praise on Young and hinted at her potential elevation, telling her: Youll get my support, maybe for both jobs.
Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) was more blunt: You may be more than deputy.
While Republicans did not hide their support for her, Young was careful throughout the hearing to compliment Tanden, showing no signs of the impending withdrawal. She said that she and Tanden would make a great team if both of us were confirmed.
Democrats on the committee, too, lauded Young's work in Congress, but they remained united in supporting Tanden. 
If Biden taps Young for the top spot, several others could be considered for the deputy role, including Ann O'Leary, a longtime Hillary Clinton policy aide, and Sarah Bianchi, a longtime Biden policy aide.
