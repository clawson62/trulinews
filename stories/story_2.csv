Below are some facts about the court, based in The Hague, Netherlands.
* The ICC was established in 2002 to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression when member states are unwilling or unable to do so themselves. It can prosecute crimes committed by nationals of member states or on the territory of member states by other actors. It has 123 member states and an annual budget of roughly 150 million euros ($180 million).
* The ICC has convicted five men for war crimes and crimes against humanity, all African militia leaders from DR Congo, Mali and Uganda. Sentences range from nine to 30 years in prison.
The maximum possible sentence is life imprisonment.
* The ICC is currently conducting 13 other formal investigations, including into Afghanistan, Bangladesh/Myanmar and Georgia. It has a further 13 so-called preliminary examinations, including in Venezuela, Philippines and Ukraine.
* The ICCs most wanted fugitive is former Sudanese leader Omar al Bashir, wanted for genocide in Darfur. The first former head of state ever to appear before the ICC, former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo, was acquitted of all charges in 2019 after a 3-year trial.
*Although the court is supported by many United Nations members and the European Union, other major powers like the United States, China, Russia and Israel are not members, and argue it could be used for politically motivated prosecutions.
*The courts prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, finishes a nine-year term on June 15 and will be replaced by British barrister Karim Khan, known for heading the U.N. special investigative team looking into Islamic State crimes in Iraq.
* A five-year preliminary examination by Bensoudas office into the Palestinian Territories concluded that there is a reasonable basis to believe:
- Israeli forces committed war crimes during Gaza hostilities in 2014, including disproportionate attacks and wilful killing.
- In the context of Israels occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, members of the Israeli authorities have committed war crimes by allowing settlers to live there.
- Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups committed intentional attacks on civilians, wilful killing and torture in Gaza in the same period since 2014.
- Israeli forces used lethal and non-lethal force against demonstrators in March 2018 near the border fence between the Gaza Strip and Israel which allegedly resulted in the killing of over 200 people and the wounding of thousands of others.",Factbox: What is the International Criminal Court? - Reuters India The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday opened a formal investigation into possible war crimes committed in the Palestinian Territories.,Reuters,reuters,32,-0.9201,['international criminal court'],[0.38],0.3329049971177377

The move coincided with President Tayyip Erdogans pledge on Tuesday to strengthen freedom of expression and rights to a fair trial in an action plan that critics said did not address concern about an erosion of human rights in Turkey.
The HDP has faced growing pressure after Ankara said last month Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants executed 13 prisoners, including Turkish military and police personnel, during an army operation to rescue them in Iraqs Gara region.
A senior member of Erdogans ruling AK Party on Tuesday endorsed nationalist calls for the closure of the HDP, which has 56 members in the 660-seat assembly. It is accused of links to the banned PKK, which it denies.
The judiciary has begun an enquiry, an AKP official told Reuters. The appeals court has sprung into action. The possibility of it being closed appears pretty high.
Turkey has a long history of banning parties although they have often been able to re-form under new names. The official said measures may be taken to prevent this happening again.
A crackdown on the HDP in recent years has included the arrests of thousands of party officials and members, while dozens of its elected mayors and lawmakers have been ousted. It was defiant over the latest pressure.
The efforts to shut us down will diminish them further and make us grow more, HDP co-leader Mithat Sancar told his partys lawmakers on Tuesday, recalling the banning of a previous pro-Kurdish party in 1994.
After they closed the party the same political tradition grew in waves, he said. They will see very clearly that we will emerge stronger from this tyrannical darkness.
Many HDP deputies already face bids to lift their immunity from prosecution. The partys jailed former leader is among those charged over deadly 2014 protests in Turkey calling for action to protect Kurds in Syria from Islamic State.
Another official said the appeals court had sought from prosecutors copies of the indictment over the 2014 protests and details of cases against HDP deputies, and will examine whether the party is a focus for PKK activities.
A nationalist party allied to Erdogans government repeated on Tuesday its call for the HDPs closure over links to the PKK, which Turkey, the European Union and United States designate a terrorist group.
More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict since the PKK launched its insurgency in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey in 1984.","Turkish court probes pro-Kurdish party as pressure for ban grows: officials - Reuters Turkey's top appeals court has launched an enquiry into the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) over alleged links to militants in a step that could ultimately lead to a ban on the third biggest party in parliament, officials said on Wednesday.",Reuters,reuters,54,-0.0,"['party', 'pro', 'ban', 'court', 'official']","[0.372, 0.301, 0.264, 0.224, 0.199]",0.23772943039299094
Benjamin Siegel,House Democrats push to pass election reforms as GOP moves to change voting laws,House Democrats on Wednesday are expected to pass new voting rights as GOP-controlled state legislatures move to change laws in the wake of the 2020 election.,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-democrats-push-pass-election-reforms-gop-moves/story?id=76182685,https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/nancy-pelosi_hpMain_20210226-225138_16x9_992.jpg,2021-03-03T14:01:47Z,"The House on Wednesday is expected to pass a sweeping ethics and voting rights package first introduced in 2019, one Democrats say is urgently needed as GOP-controlled state legislatures scramble to change voting laws in the wake of the presidential election.
The ""For the People Act of 2021"" would automatically register people to vote and restore the voting rights of felons. It would also mandate more than two weeks of early voting, encourage voting-by-mail and expand absentee ballot drop boxes across the country -- along with other provisions meant to address concerns raised by election officials during the 2020 election cycle.
""Were not pursuing this reform against the backdrop of the status quo. Were pursuing it against the prospect that the Republicans will take things in the wrong direction, and in a significant way,"" Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., the lead sponsor of the bill told ABC News.
Following Donald Trumps loss to Joe Biden in November, Republicans across the country have introduced hundreds of proposals to change voting laws, arguing that the changes are needed to restore trust in the election system.
The efforts follow Trump and some Republicans extended campaign to undermine the election results with unproven claims of widespread voter fraud, and the Trump campaigns repeated failures to challenge state-level results in court.
On Monday, the Republican-controlled state legislature in Georgia -- where turnout helped Biden win in November, and two Democrats win the states Senate seats in January -- approved a new measure changing the states absentee voting laws, over the objections of Democrats and voting rights advocates.
And on Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case over two Arizona election laws, with conservatives on the court weighing whether to limit what Democrats consider to be key protections against racial discrimination in the Voting Rights Act.
""There is a new and palpable intensity to voter suppression, particularly targeting communities of color, Daniel Weiner, the deputy director of the Brennan Centers Election Reform Program, said of the new voting law proposals pushed by Republicans this year. ""There is, frankly, an alarming willingness to push these policies based on false premises, and those are premises that have been amplified by the former president.""
Congressional Republicans are expected to oppose the legislation on the floor, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., accusing Democrats of prioritizing legislation to protect themselves to get reelected over other major issues.
""The priorities here are wrong,"" McCarthy said Tuesday during debate on the legislation.
Trump also attacked the legislation in his speech on Sunday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, calling it a ""monster"" that ""cannot be allowed to pass,"" pointing to provisions meant to expand access to voting.
Lawmakers spent much of Tuesday considering amendments to the package.
In addition to the voting law changes, the legislation would require presidential candidates to release at least ten years of tax returns, and the spending of presidential inaugural committees -- along with other provisions crafted in 2019 in response to Trumps unwillingness to share his tax returns, and the federal investigation into his inaugural spending. It would also require campaigns to report any contacts with foreign officials.
The nearly 800-page package also includes provisions to bolster election security at the state and federal levels, require social media platforms to maintain databases of political ads, and require states to set up independent redistricting commissions to redraw their congressional districts and prevent partisan gerrymandering -- two provisions Democrats point to ahead of the redrawing of the congressional map following the 2020 census.
The legislation would also create a new 6-to-1 matching system for political donations of up to $200 for presidential and congressional candidates who reject large contributions -- which Republicans have decried as public financing of campaigns. The funds would be generated by financial and corporate settlements.
The American Action Network, a GOP advocacy group, is seizing on that line of attack, running digital ads in 15 Democratic congressional districts urging votes against the legislation.
The legislation, like other key pieces of House Democrats agenda, will head to the Democrat-controlled Senate, but is expected to languish given a lack of Republican support. Democrats need the backing of 10 Republicans to advance the package past the 60-vote threshold.
Still, advocates say the passage of the measure is necessary in the House to put more pressure on Senate Democrats to consider changing the chambers rules and eliminating the legislative filibuster, in order to pass their priorities through the narrowly-divided Senate when Democrats control Congress and the White House.
""Its going to be hard without looking at reforming the filibuster,"" Sarbanes said of passing HR 1. ""This sends a very clear message to our colleagues in the Senate of the high priority.""
That pressure could also build in the coming weeks when the House sends immigration reform, gun control and criminal justice reform legislation to the Senate, pitting progressives against moderates such as Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., who fiercely opposes changing the Senates rules.",House Democrats push to pass election reforms as GOP moves to change voting laws House Democrats on Wednesday are expected to pass new voting rights as GOP-controlled state legislatures move to change laws in the wake of the 2020 election.,ABC News,abc-news,40,0.0,"['house democrat', 'pas', 'voting', 'gop', 'change']","[0.365, 0.327, 0.299, 0.281, 0.262]",0.15768007413651328

Affirming U.S. support for Israel, Price said the ICC has no jurisdiction over this matter,"" which he said ""unfairly"" targets the Jewish State.
Israel is not a party to the ICC, and it has not consented to the court's jurisdiction and we have serious concerns about the ICC's attempts to exercise its jurisdiction over Israeli personnel, Price said, and echoed the U.S. view that the Palestinians do not meet the qualifications for a sovereign state required for the ICCs involvement.
The position of the Biden administration puts it in line with the policy of the former Trump administration, which criticized the ICC as unfairly targeting Israel.
Price further said that the Biden administration is reviewing an executive order from former President TrumpDonald TrumpSouth Carolina Senate adds firing squad as alternative execution method Ex-Trump aide Pierson won't run for Dallas-area House seatHouse Oversight panel reissues subpoena for Trump's accounting firmMORE that imposed sanctions on the ICCs chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and her top deputies over efforts investigating alleged war crimes by the U.S. in Afghanistan.
The sanctions, where Bensouda was added to the Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons List, are typically used for terrorists and drug traffickers.
Much as we disagree with the ICC's actions relating to the Palestinian situation, and of course to Afghanistan we are thoroughly reviewing sanctions pursuant to Executive Order 13928, as we determine our next steps, he said.
His remarks came in response to an announcement earlier Wednesday from Bensouda that the ICC will open an investigation into alleged war crimes by Israel in the Palestinian territories since June 2014 in particular related to the summer war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip and also including allegations of war crimes in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.
The decision to open an investigation was five years in the making as Palestinians pleaded for Israeli accountability on the international stage and Israel, along with the U.S., opposed the measures as biased and beyond the reach of the court.
Bensouda said in a statement the court was pursuing the investigation in accordance with an earlier ruling that was unanimous in its view that Palestine is a State Party to the Rome Statute, the agreement that governs the countries where the ICC has jurisdiction.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry welcomed the decision by the ICC, saying in a statement that this is a long-awaited step that serves Palestines tireless pursuit of justice and accountability, which are indispensable pillars of the peace the Palestinian people seek and deserve.
But it was rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuBenjamin (Bibi) NetanyahuMORE, calling the announcement absurd.
It's undiluted antisemitism and the height of hypocrisy, he tweeted.

The Israeli ambassador to the United States and United Nations, Gilad Erdan, said that Israel would continue working together with the American administration against this shameful decision.
In May, Republican and Democratic lawmakers had urged the former Trump administration to defend Israel from the probe, saying the ICC has no jurisdiction in Israel or the Palestinian territories.","Biden admin: International Criminal Court 'unfairly' targeting Israel The Biden administration opposes and is disappointed with the decision by the International Criminal Court to pursue an investigation into alleged Israeli war crimes in the Palestinian territories, State Department spokes...",The Hill,the-hill,39,-0.9538,['international criminal court'],[0.348],0.3219901849185052

Ahmed Kabir Kishore faces charges of creating confusion over the governments handling of the coronavirus pandemic and contributing to the deterioration of law and order in the country, but rights groups say the use of the Digital Security Act against him is a repressive measure.
Kishore is now in prison outside the capital, Dhaka, and his lawyer said he has been tortured in custody.
A two-member panel of judges from the High Court issued the order of his bail on health grounds, said his lawyer Jotirmoy Barua.
Barua told the court that Kishore's right ear was nearly impaired and a scar had developed on his left leg because of physical torture.
Wednesdays bail decision followed an outcry by protesters in the streets and on social media after writer and commentator Mushtaq Ahmed died in custody last Thursday.
Both Kishore and Ahmed were arrested on May 5 last year in Dhaka in a single case under the Digital Security Act. Ahmed was arrested for making comments on social media that criticized the governments handling of the pandemic. Ahmed had been denied bail at least six times. At least nine other people were also charged with similar charges in the same case Ahmed and Kishore faced.
On Wednesday, dozens of people rallied in front of the National Press Club in Dhaka and attempted to march toward the Prime Ministers Office to demand justice for Ahmed and the release of Kishore. They also demanded the annulment of the Digital Security Act.
The 2018 Digital Security Act includes a jail sentence of up to 14 years for any propaganda or campaign against the countrys independence war, its founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the national anthem or flag. It also says a person can be jailed for up to 10 years for destroying communal harmony or creating unrest or disorder.
The broad characterization of charges led Amnesty International to conclude that the law is plagued by a lack of clear definitions, explanations and exceptions, including repressive non-bailable penalties for at least 14 offenses.

SONIA PÉREZ D. Associated Press,Guatemala begins reshaping court; corruption concerns grow,"Guatemala’s Congress has begun reshaping the country’s highest court, selecting a new magistrate and an alternate in decisions that could have grave consequences for the battle against corruption and impunity",https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/guatemala-begins-reshaping-court-corruption-concerns-grow-76214797,null,2021-03-03T01:02:43Z,"GUATEMALA CITY -- Guatemalas Congress began reshaping the countrys highest court Tuesday, selecting a new magistrate and an alternate in decisions that could have grave consequences for the battle against corruption and impunity.
In an initial vote Tuesday, current magistrate Dina Ochoa received a majority of votes (101 of 160 lawmakers), putting her on a path to a likely second consecutive term. She was originally former President Jimmy Morales pick to the current court. Ochoa has been criticized for decisions to protect a fugitive judge accused of corruption and to eject the United Nations anti-corruption mission, known as CICIG.
Selecting the new members of the Constitutional Court has roiled Guatemalan politics since last year. The congressional selections Tuesday were the first of a series of sectors charged with picking the new court.
The court decides almost all of the most contentious political, judicial and criminal issues that arise in Guatemala and the outgoing court was seen as an important bulwark against some of the most ill-intentioned legal maneuvers. The members will hold their seats for five years and the selection process has been filled with accusations of collusion and corruption.
The stakes are so high because the next court will likely decide the fate of politicians accused of corruption like former President Otto Pérez Molina, military officers convicted of crimes against humanity and the potential candidacy of Zury Ríos, daughter of ex-dictator Efraín Ríos Montt, constitutionally banned from running.
The Constitutional Court is the last step in Guatemalas justice system, so the selection process has drawn the attention of not only Guatemalans, but outsiders concerned with the rule of law in the country. Tuesdays votes were preceded by a handful of arrest orders last week against people directly involved in the process, though for meddling in the selection of judges on other courts.
The court is made up of five magistrates and five alternates. The congress picks a magistrate and alternate Tuesday and then Guatemalas bar association, public university council, president and Supreme Court pick the remaining members.
Activists, lawyers and other observers have widely criticized the process already for attempts to manipulate the results, influence peddling and other alleged crimes.
Last week, Guatemalan authorities requested arrest orders for several people involved in the selection of magistrates or candidates to the court.
One was for the rector of University of San Carlos de Guatemala, Murphy Paíz, one of those who would help choose new Constitutional Court members, for allegedly colluding on votes. He said he would present himself to authorities to resolve the matter, but instead checked himself into a hospital where he was under guard.
Authorities did arrest Luis Fernando Ruiz, former president of the bar association, and himself a candidate as an alternate to the court. They did not find the former rector of Paizs university, Estuardo Galvez, who is a candidate to be a magistrate on the court. He released a video on social media arguing that he was the victim of political persecution.
Elvyn Díaz, a lawyer at the Institute for Penal Studies, said the court is an attractive target for co-opting for a number of reasons. With the demise of the United Nations-backed anti-corruption mission in Guatemala that helped bring a number of important corruption prosecutions, there is great interest in maintaining impunity among those at risk. In Guatemalas justice system, everything can eventually arrive at the Constitutional Court, he said.
Also, the outgoing court laid out important criteria in areas including human rights and the extraction of natural resources that affected deals that large investors had made with the political class, he said.
Finally, and perhaps the most important, according to Díaz, is that the outgoing court played a critical role as a check on political power. They dont want to have a court that limits arbitrary acts and questions their exercise of power, he said.
That factor appears to be driving public statements from the U.S. State Department in recent weeks.
On Tuesday, Julie Chung, U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs, said via Twitter: The fight against corruption in Guatemala requires candidates to the Constitutional Court that demonstrate integrity and impartiality and are free from outside influence or unresolved criminal charges.","Guatemala begins reshaping court; corruption concerns grow Guatemala’s Congress has begun reshaping the country’s highest court, selecting a new magistrate and an alternate in decisions that could have grave consequences for the battle against corruption and impunity",ABC News,abc-news,37,-0.6369,"['corruption', 'court', 'grave', 'consequence', 'begun']","[0.514, 0.343, 0.312, 0.291, 0.262]",0.20673197084727257
